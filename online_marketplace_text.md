# Online Marketplace

In our online marketplace, we have customers who can place orders for various products. Each customer has a unique username and an email address. They can also create wishlists to keep track of products they're interested in, and they can add products to these wishlists. Customers can also share their experiences with products by writing reviews.

On the other side of the marketplace, we have sellers who can list their products for sale. Each seller has a name and a rating that reflects their reputation on the marketplace. They can add new products to their listings, remove products, or update existing products.

The products listed by the sellers have a title, a description, a price, and a stock quantity. There's also a special type of product, known as a premium product, that comes with extra features.

Customers can add multiple products to their orders. Each order is associated with a customer and contains multiple order items. Each order has an order number, an order date, and a status.

Each order item is associated with a product and belongs to an order. It specifies the quantity of the product ordered.

Customers can write reviews for products. Each review is associated with a product and has a rating and a comment.

Each order is associated with a shipping address, which includes the street, city, state, country, and zip code. It's important to note that the shipping address is not saved in the customer's profile but is associated with each individual order.

Finally, each order is associated with a payment, which includes the payment method, the amount paid, and the payment date. Similar to the shipping address, the payment method is not saved in the customer's profile but is associated with each individual order.
